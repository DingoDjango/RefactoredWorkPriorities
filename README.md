Grants you additional control over colonists, including some tweaks to their work priorities and schedules.

The mod includes an options menu (**Options > Mod Settings**).

* **Injured animals** will be fed by handlers instead of doctors.
* **Removing roofs** prioritised above building roofs.
* **Custom repair threshold** - you decide when repairs should be made.
* **Prioritise rottables** - haul corn, meals etc. as a high priority.
* **Prioritise deterioratables** - haul items as a high priority.
* **Set an item HP threshold** to avoid prioritising items with low HP.
